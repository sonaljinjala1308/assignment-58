    "For predicting house prices using an SVM regression model, several regression metrics can be employed to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "The choice of the best metric depends on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the evaluation criteria that matter most for your \n",
    "application. Here are some common regression metrics to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: MAE is suitable when you want a simple and interpretable metric that measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual\n",
    "values.\n",
    "Interpretation: A lower MAE indicates that the model's predictions are, on average, closer to the true house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: MSE gives more weight to larger errors and is useful when you want to penalize larger prediction errors more heavily.\n",
    "Interpretation: A lower MSE implies that the model is better at reducing the impact of outliers or large errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: RMSE is similar to MSE but provides results in the same unit as the target variable (house price in this case), making it easier to \n",
    "interpret.\n",
    "Interpretation: A lower RMSE indicates that, on average, the model's predictions are closer to the true house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R-squared (R2) Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: R2 measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. It assesses the goodness of fit.\n",
    "Interpretation: An R2 score closer to 1 indicates that the model explains a large portion of the variance in house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjusted R-squared:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Adjusted R2 is an extension of R2 that takes into account the number of features in the model. It is useful when you want to avoid \n",
    "overfitting.\n",
    "Interpretation: A higher adjusted R2 indicates that the model explains a significant portion of the variance while accounting for the complexity of \n",
    "the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):\n",

    "Use Case: MAPE is useful when you want to express prediction errors as a percentage of the actual values, making it easy to understand the relative\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean Squared Error (MSE): \n",
    "MSE measures the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It gives more significant weight to larger errors. In the context of predicting house prices, MSE penalizes larger prediction errors more heavily, which aligns well with the goal of accurately  predicting prices. Minimizing MSE essentially means minimizing the average squared error between your predictions and the actual prices, leading to more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### R-squared (R2): \n",
    "R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. While it's a valuable metric for understanding the goodness of fit, it doesn't directly measure prediction accuracy. A high R2 score indicates that the model explains a large portion of the variance in the target variable but doesn't necessarily mean that the predictions are accurate in terms of absolute price values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, if your primary objective is to predict house prices as accurately as possible, prioritize minimizing MSE when evaluating your SVM regression model. It provides a direct measure of prediction accuracy and aligns with the goal of minimizing prediction errors in terms of actual price values."

    "When dealing with a dataset that has a significant number of outliers, the most appropriate regression metric to use with your Support Vector \n",
    "Machine (SVM) model is the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why MAE is a suitable choice in this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Robustness to Outliers: \n",
    "MAE is robust to outliers because it measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Outliers with large deviations from the true values contribute directly to the absolute errors in MAE. Unlike the Mean Squared Error (MSE), which squares errors and gives more weight to outliers, MAE treats all errors, including those caused by outliers, with equal importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretability: \n",
    "MAE provides easily interpretable results. It represents the average magnitude of errors in the same unit as the target variable. This makes it straightforward to explain the model's performance, especially when dealing with stakeholders who may not be familiar with the intricacies of regression metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Focus on Prediction Accuracy: \n",
    "If your primary goal is to obtain accurate predictions for the majority of data points while minimizing the impact of outliers, MAE is well-suited for this purpose. It allows you to assess how well your SVM model performs in terms of predicting actual values while being less sensitive to extreme values that may exist due to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, when working with a dataset that contains a significant number of outliers, MAE is a reliable choice for evaluating your SVM regression \n",
    "model's performance. It balances the need for accuracy in predicting the majority of data points with robustness against the influence of outliers, \n",
    "providing a practical and interpretable metric."

    "this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RMSE's Interpretability: \n",
    "RMSE provides the same unit of measurement as the target variable (in this case, the house prices). This makes it easier to interpret because it quantifies the average prediction error in the same unit as the quantity you are trying to predict. For example, if you are predicting house prices in dollars, RMSE will be in dollars, which is more interpretable compared to MSE, which is in squared units.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### RMSE's Sensitivity to Outliers: \n",
    "RMSE, being the square root of MSE, has a natural dampening effect on large errors or outliers. This is desirable when working with regression models because it helps reduce the influence of extreme errors on the overall metric. In contrast, MSE can be heavily influenced by outliers, as it squares the errors, giving them more weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consistency with the Data Scale: \n",
    "RMSE tends to align better with the scale of the data, making it a more intuitive choice when dealing with polynomial regression. It provides a meaningful measure of the average prediction error that's consistent with the data's units.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, both MSE and RMSE are suitable metrics for evaluating regression models. If the difference between the two values is very small, it may \n",
    "not have a significant impact on model assessment. However, RMSE often provides a more intuitive and interpretable evaluation, especially when\n",

    "Here's why R-squared is suitable for this purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Variance: \n",
    "R-squared quantifies the proportion of variance in the target variable (i.e., the dependent variable) that is explained by the independent variables (features) included in your model. In other words, it assesses the goodness of fit of your model in capturing the variability in the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretability: \n",
    "R-squared has an intuitive interpretation. A higher R-squared value indicates that a larger proportion of the variance in the target variable is accounted for by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates that the model explains all the variance, and 0 indicates that the model provides no improvement over using the mean as a predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison Across Models: \n",
    "R-squared allows you to compare the explanatory power of different SVM regression models with various kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF). You can select the model with the highest R-squared value as the one that best explains the variance in the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When using R-squared to compare SVM regression models with different kernels, keep in mind that a higher R-squared value indicates a better ability \n",
